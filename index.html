Introduction 
    
  </h>
  <p>
Hello! Welcome to my CS500 final project. I’ve made a short website about some of my favorite songs. At a place as stressful as Andover, I’ve started to go for walks listening to music to leave all the stressors of school behind. It’s nice to carve out time for yourself once in a while. 

But music is more than stress relieving. Often, I think that songs speak to truths about ourselves whether we’re aware of them or not. For instance, I have a lot of family scattered in the American South. The soul and hip hop I listen to whenever I visit has heavily influenced my playlists. No matter where I turn to Spotify, the tracks that I play will likely be some homage to my extended family. But music can definitely speak to emotions that we can’t yet understand. Wrapping up my four years of Andover, I feel a weird mix of nostalgia, relief, regret, and happiness, and the music I listen to absolutely reflects that. In no particular order, I’ll discuss some of the music I have on repeat and a food I associate with them. You should definitely check them out for themselves. </p></div>

Janet Jackson released Together Again in 1997 in tribute to a friend who died of AIDS. The song is warm, nostalgic, and comforting. Instead of mourning her friend, she happily reflects on the time they’ve spent and she assures him that they’ll reunite “together again” in the afterlife. She also feels comforted that he will no longer suffer after death: “Dancin’ in moonlight, I know you are free.” Connecting this to my own life, it’s really difficult to leave many of my friends from the past four years. Oddly, I’m glad that many of my friends will be leaving a school that demands so much of them. At the end of the day, I’m more sentimental of the good times I’ve had here more than I’m upset that people are leaving. If this song was a food, it’d be pepperoni pizza. It’s meant to be shared by many over laughter and fun.

Ain’t No Way- Aretha Franklin

Without a doubt, this song is fried catfish. The song is Southern and soulful. The bridge is a classic, and it’s a song that has withstood the test of time. The original audio is clearly recorded on an old mic, and the rawness and imperfection of the audio adds to the song’s old and nostalgic feel. There’s some crackling and volume spikes that make this song perfect. Ain’t No Way is about loving someone who’s hesitant to accept love. Franklin asks, “how can I give ya… all the things I can /  If you’re tyin’ both my hands.” Being completely honest, whenever I play this I think more of my family and instruments than the actual lyrics. Just a 10/10 song.

I inherited this song from my sister’s emo phase in middle school. She would listen to MCR, Twenty One Pilots, Panic! At the Disco, and Pierce the Veil to name a few bands. She would shop at Hot Topic and bring home hair dye and eye make-up. I think I just heard this song so many times in the background that I just started liking it, too. I don’t really listen to the lyrics, but the instrumentals go HARD and it’s nice to listen to when you have a lot of stress. This song is a glass of really cold water– extremely refreshing.</p> </p>

When I was younger, I had a Colombian babysitter who would play this song nonstop on the car ride to school. Like Helena, I think its lyrics have been fused to my brain through osmosis. The song’s completely in Spanish, and so I had absolutely no clue what it was about when I first heard it. I had to rely on the trumpets, the drums, and just about the catchiest chorus I’ve ever heard in my life. Turns out, the song is about a man who cheated on his girlfriend who begs for forgiveness. I had no idea what I was singing! If this song was a food, to me it’d be a blood sausage. Blood sausage is an authentic Colombian dish that I’ve had multiple times with my babysitter, and this song will always take me back to my childhood with her. </p></div>

This is such a vulnerable and genuine performance. Before she starts singing, she establishes an authentic tone by attributing the night for her “daddy.” The stage is simple. No flashy dancers or props. Just 2 people and a guitar ready to take the night. Their chemistry on stage is golden. I love seeing Stevie move her fingers during the instrumental interlude with the man on the guitar. They make solid eye contact to show how they are both invested in the performance. He also closes her eyes because Stevie’s singing is so awesome that he lets the music take him. I also love Stevie’s voice in this. It’s a little lower and rougher than a lot of people on the radio and adds to the performance's authentic feel. There’s a very clear connection here to leaving Andover. The song’s about being afraid of change. I used to be afraid but I don’t think I am anymore. 

    I don’t have a food for this. Nothing fits. </p>
